# GameProject
Want to learn to play piano but don't have access to a physical instrument? MusiMania teaches elementary-aged students to play piano through guided levels on treble and base clef sheet music reading as well as piano fingerings and historical facts! This project is written entirely in Java and utilizes the Java GUI.
